This is my first module.

Thinkig that it would be more efficient to create my own call to the DB (rather than call node_load), I have a very funky query in there with lots of joins. As such, the module breaks if you change the structure of the table (which CCK does if you add the "section banner" field to any other content type).

Suffice it to say, you have no need to use this module...

This is a change.
